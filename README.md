# School District Analysis

## Overview
I repeated my school district analysis after removing the 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School due to academic dishonesty.  I also investigated how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
-- The percentage passing math went up from 75.0% to 85.7%
-- The percentage passing reading went down from 85.8% to 74.8%
-- The percentage of overall passing went down from 65.2% to 64.9%
- How is the school summary afefcted?
-- The school summary was only affected for Thomas High School's data.
- How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
-- After replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores, Thomas High School remained the top 2 school.
- How does replacing the ninth-gradd scores affect the following:
-- Math and reading scores by grade
---Thomas High School would not have a reading score or math score for 9th grade.
-- Scores by school spending
--- The scores by school spending remain unchanged.
-- Scores by school size
--- The scores by school size remain unchanged.
-- Scores by school type
    The scores by school size remain unchanged.

## Summary
Changing Thomas High School's 9th grade math and reading scores to NaN values affected the district summary but not the school summary--except for the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School.
